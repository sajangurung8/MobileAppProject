# Car Care Log App

Sajan Gurung

A Flutter project for an app for tracking vehicle maintenance. This project is implemented using informaion in README.md file on the root folder.

This project is currently in its prototype phase, with screens that have minimal, functional buttons to demonstrate navigation and interaction between pages. Both the Reminder and Report screens use placeholder values that will be updated in future versions. The app utilizes an SQLite database to store car information and follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern to ensure clear separation of component responsibilities. In this prototype, users can add a car, create tasks, and add steps to each task to illustrate the expected functionality.
