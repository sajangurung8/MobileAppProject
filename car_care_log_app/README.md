# Car Care Log App

Sajan Gurung

A Flutter project for an app for tracking vehicle maintenance. This project is implemented using informaion in README.md file on the root folder.

This project is currently in its prototype phase, with screens that have minimal, functional buttons to demonstrate navigation and interaction between pages. Both the Reminder and Report screens use placeholder values that will be updated in future versions. The app utilizes an SQLite database to store car information and follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern to ensure clear separation of component responsibilities. In this prototype, users can add a car, create tasks, and add steps to each task to illustrate the expected functionality.

     - Add logic to update task steps on the task info screen.

2. **Enhanced Reminder Functionality**
   - The Reminder screen should include reminders for completed tasks.
     - Prompt users to set the next due date for tasks.
     - Sort reminders by upcoming due date on the Reminder screen.

     - Update the Report screen to show a list of all tasks.
     - Create a screen to display detailed task reports.

5. **Car Status Indicators**
   - Each car should display a status indicator based on the completion of tasks and steps.
     - Add logic to update the car status color to reflect task statuses.

# Basic Functionality

The Car Care Log app's current version includes essential functionality, as described below.

- Add Car, Task, and Task Steps: Users can add a car, create tasks, and add detailed steps for each task. All data is stored locally on the device.
- Task Step Navigation: Users can follow tasks step-by-step on the Task Info screen.
- Reference Video Support: If a reference youtube video url is saved during task creation, users can watch it by clicking the "Watch Video" button on the Task Info screen. This launches the YouTube app if installed or plays the video in the device's default web browser.
- Reminders Setup: Upon task completion, users can mark the task as complete and set up reminders based on mileage and time. Added reminders are accessible from the Reminders page.

## State Management

The app utilizes appropriate state management with Stateful widgets for individual pages and the overall application. On the Task Info page, if the user navigates to another app or the app goes into an inactive state (e.g., when launching the YouTube app), the user's progress is retained. This ensures that the current step and page state are saved, maintaining a seamless user experience even when switching between apps.

## Remaining Wrok to be completed for next phase

- Mileage Updates and Notifications: Implement a feature that allows users to update the car's mileage and receive push notifications based on the new mileage.
- Calendar Integration: Add functionality for users to create calendar events in their personal calendar based on reminder dates.
- Reports Page: Develop a Reports page that provides users with a comprehensive list of required tools to prepare for tasks.
