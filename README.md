1. The intended platform for final project is both iOS and android.
2. Intended framework/programming language for app development is Flutter/Dart.
3. I want to explore cross-platform development.
4. I want to work on a mobile application project that is very inclusive where regardless of choice of the platform, users can run on their devices and benefit from the app. I recently discovered that the research group I plan to join is using flutter so want to get comfortable with the framework.
