1. The intended platform for final project is both iOS and android.
2. Intended framework/programming language for app development is React Native/javascript.
3. I want to explore cross-platform development.
4. I want to work on a mobile application project that is very inclusive where regardless of choice of the platform, users can run on their devices and benefit from the app. I have developed web applications using React before and want to learn about the similarities and differences of React for the web and React Native.
